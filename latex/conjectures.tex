\paragraph{}1. Store the number of times a given label appears as a graceful
end. Furthermore, store the number of times a leaf takes on a given label.
\paragraph{}2. The ratio of graceful ends to lattice points of $n$-1-1 graphs tend
to infinity as $n$ goes to infinity.
\paragraph{}3. (More of an observation) The ratio of graceful ends over total
number of permutations is not interesting (tends to zero very rapidly).
\paragraph{}4. The length of the longest path of the tree is related to the
number of graceful ends (or number of lattice points).
\paragraph{}5. Try all possible orders of vertices and track the time required
to find all graceful labelings.
